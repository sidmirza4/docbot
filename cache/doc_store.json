He first read the \\r\\nQuran 1992, in order to discredit it. Since then, Talal has \\r\\nbeen studying the Quran, researching it, and teaching it to \\r\\nothers. Talal decided to translate the Quran when he gave \\r\\nup all hope of finding an English Translation that is at the \\r\\nsame time highly accurate, and very easy to read.

It contains Mercy and Heal-\\r\\ning, and it is beyond doubt from the Lord of the Worlds. ”\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"3b2cdb16-4697-40fb-aead-b59ba7ce2658":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"3b2cdb16-4697-40fb-aead-b59ba7ce2658\",\"metadata\":{},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"+f8Mln6kY6dWMLO+GpdxjDG/8NW1RKxE8Tg5G+T/Sqc=\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"Djusy5AE0Rk+nb9yHonKKe3OIQSdRgN2hscd1kWdgQE=\"}},\"hash\":\"TD4wYdRD47YQHgQfIQINEGkP8LJFgdh8UnUePBCeMR8=\",\"text\":\"TABLE OF CONTENTS \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n1.

THE ROMANS  (ar-Rum) \\r\\n \\r\\n211 \\r\\n \\r\\n35. Have We sent down to them any au-\\r\\nthority, which speaks in support of their \\r\\nidols? 36. When We give people a taste of mercy, \\r\\nthey rejoice in it. But when adversity be-\\r\\nfalls them, because of what their hands \\r\\nhave perpetrated, they begin to despair. 37. Do they not see that God expands the \\r\\nprovision for whomever He wills, or re-\\r\\nstricts it? Surely in this are signs for people \\r\\nwho believe. 38. So give the relative his rights, and the \\r\\ndestitute, and the wayfarer. That is best for \\r\\nthose who seek God’s presence. Those are \\r\\nthe prosperous. 39. The usury you practice, seeking thereby \\r\\nto multiply people’s wealth, will not mul-\\r\\ntiply with God. But what you give in chari-\\r\\nty, desiring God’s approval—these are the \\r\\nmultipliers. 40. God is He who created you, then pro-\\r\\nvides for you, then makes you die, then \\r\\nbrings you back to life. Can any of your \\r\\nidols do any of that? Glorified is He, and \\r\\nExalted above what they associate. 41. Corruption has appeared on land and \\r\\nsea, because of what people’s hands have \\r\\nearned, in order to make them taste some \\r\\nof what they have done, so that they might \\r\\nreturn. 42. Say, “Roam the earth, and observe the \\r\\nfate of those who came before. Most of \\r\\nthem were idolaters. ” \\r\\n43. So devote yourself to the upright reli-\\r\\ngion, before there comes from God a Day \\r\\nthat cannot be averted. On that Day, they \\r\\nwill be shocked. 44. Whoever disbelieves, upon him falls his \\r\\ndisbelief. And whoever acts righteously—\\r\\nthey are preparing for themselves. 45. So that He may reward those who have \\r\\nbelieved and done the righteous deeds out \\r\\nof His bounty. Indeed, He does not love \\r\\nthe ungrateful. 46.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"fca6f829-b80e-4cbd-a094-98c460df7a85":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"fca6f829-b80e-4cbd-a094-98c460df7a85\",\"metadata\":{},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"cinCXVQm3VJvyRdcTr8JawnEKZ8gHiey7b70lmoTJM4=\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"8o0ivmVsJwTTczMYeyH/7GQkq6jDX8pu4TGcUMvwEao=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"1f0938e7-9e8d-4e96-b710-8e6705f6ce5d\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"WvNETjhu0KkESq8/7be2DcSbcwPsAVIqDennRNM2ogE=\"}},\"hash\":\"SioWO2N3pDFZatZy0iYQpJ1Tskg9MpUopDQlcz14ALI=\",\"text\":\"Indeed, He does not love \\r\\nthe ungrateful. 46.

But when he showed them Our signs, \\r\\nthey started laughing at them. 48. Each sign We showed them was more \\r\\nmarvelous than its counterpart.

Thus We made them a precedent and \\r\\nan example for the others. 57. And when the son of Mary was cited as \\r\\nan example, your people opposed. 58. They said, “Are our gods better, or he? ” \\r\\nThey cited him only for argument. In fact, \\r\\nthey are a quarrelsome people. 59. He was just a servant whom We \\r\\nblessed, and We made him an example for \\r\\nthe Children of Israel. 60. Had We willed, We would have made \\r\\nof you angels to be successors on earth. 61.
